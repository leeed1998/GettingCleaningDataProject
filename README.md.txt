Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

Got really confused and frustrated as this would be so easy in SQL or SAS.  but that's not the point


Run_analysis.R that does the following

 
 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
 - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
